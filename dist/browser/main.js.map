bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * @param name An identifying string.\n * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of\n * [`state()`](api/animations/state) and `transition()` declarations.\n *\n * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n *\n * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n *\n * ### Usage Example\n *\n * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n * name value.\n * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n * transition declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: \"my-component\",\n *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n * by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using an inline function\n * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n * if its associated animation should be run.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n string]: any}): boolean {\n *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n *         // the animation sequence code\n *       ]),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations\n * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n * all animations from rendering.\n * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n * within the element.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n * along with any inner animations.\n *\n * ### Disable animations application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n  return {\n    type: AnimationMetadataType.Trigger,\n    name,\n    definitions,\n    options: {}\n  };\n}\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime.

a string with a specific syntax\n *  - or a function that compares the previous and current state (value of the expression bound to\n *    the element's trigger) and returns `true` if the transition should occur or `false` otherwise\n *\n * The string format can be:\n *  - `fromState => toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then the\n *    expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState`\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition('open => closed', animate('.5s ease-out', style({ height: 0 }) ))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `fromState <=> toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then\n *    the expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState` or vice versa\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition('enabled <=> disabled', animate('1s cubic-bezier(0.8,0.3,0,1)'))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:enter`/`:leave`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when the\n *    element enters or exists the DOM\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':enter', [\n *          style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *          animate('500ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *        ])\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:increment`/`:decrement`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when\n *    the numerical expression bound to the trigger's element has increased in value or decreased\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':increment', query('@counter', animateChild()))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - a sequence of any of the above divided by commas, which indicates that transition's animations\n *    should occur whenever one of the state change expressions matches\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```typescript\n *        transition(':increment, * => enabled, :enter', animate('1s ease', keyframes([\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 0}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1.1)', offset: 0.7}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 1})\n *        ]))),\n *      ```\n *\n * Also note that in such context:\n *  - `void` can be used to indicate the absence of the element\n *  - asterisks can be used as wildcards that match any state\n *  - (as a consequence of the above, `void => *` is equivalent to `:enter` and `* => void` is\n *    equivalent to `:leave`)\n *  - `true` and `false` also match expression values of `1` and `0` respectively (but do not match\n *    _truthy_ and _falsy_ values)\n *\n * <div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n *\n *  Be careful about entering end leaving elements as their transitions present a common\n *  pitfall for developers.\n *\n *  Note that when an element with a trigger enters the DOM its `:enter` transition always\n *  gets executed, but its `:leave` transition will not be executed if the element is removed\n *  alongside its parent (as it will be removed \"without warning\" before its transition has\n *  a chance to be executed, the only way that such transition can occur is if the element\n *  is exiting the DOM on its own).\n *\n *\n * </div>\n *\n * ### Animating to a Final State\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no `style` data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state, in such case Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n *\n * ### Usage Examples\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on\n *    the trigger's expression value\n *\n *   ```HTML\n *   <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">\n *    ...\n *   </div>\n *   ```\n *\n *   ```typescript\n *   trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *     ..., // states\n *     transition(\"on => off, open => closed\", animate(500)),\n *     transition(\"* <=> error\", query('.indicator', animateChild()))\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on custom logic dependent\n *    on the trigger's expression value and provided parameters\n *\n *    ```HTML\n *    <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"{\n *     value: stepName,\n *     params: { target: currentTarget }\n *    }\">\n *     ...\n *    </div>\n *    ```\n *\n *    ```typescript\n *    trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *      ..., // states\n *      transition(\n *        (fromState, toState, _element, params) =>\n *          ['firststep', 'laststep'].includes(fromState.toLowerCase())\n *          && toState === params?.['target'],\n *        animate('1s')\n *      )\n *    ])\n *    ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n **/\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options = null) {\n  return {\n    type: AnimationMetadataType.Transition,\n    expr: stateChangeExpr,\n    animation: steps,\n    options\n  };\n}\n/**\n * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n * values.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n *   animate('{{ time }}',\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n *   ],\n *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n * ```\n *\n * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n * passing in override parameter values.\n *\n * ```js\n * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n *   params: {\n *     time: '2s',\n *     start: 1,\n *     end: 0\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n * the default values are used.

For example:\n *\n * ```js\n * query('div', [\n *   animate(...),\n *   animate(...)\n * ], { limit: 1 })\n * ```\n *\n * By default, throws an error when zero items are found. Set the\n * `optional` flag to ignore this error.

It calculates its status by reducing the status values\n * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n * group becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormGroup` is one of the four fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with `FormControl`, `FormArray`, and `FormRecord`.\n *\n * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.\n *\n * `FormGroup` is intended for use cases where the keys are known ahead of time.\n * If you need to dynamically add and remove controls, use {@link FormRecord} instead.\n *\n * `FormGroup` accepts an optional type parameter `TControl`, which is an object type with inner\n * control types as values.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Create a form group with 2 controls\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}\n * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * ### The type argument, and optional controls\n *\n * `FormGroup` accepts one generic argument, which is an object containing its inner controls.\n * This type will usually be inferred automatically, but you can always specify it explicitly if you\n * wish.\n *\n * If you have controls that are optional (i.e. they can be removed, you can use the `?` in the\n * type):\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup<{\n *   first: FormControl<string|null>,\n *   middle?: FormControl<string|null>, // Middle name is optional.\n *   last: FormControl<string|null>,\n * }>({\n *   first: new FormControl('Nancy'),\n *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator\n *\n * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n *\n *\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in\n * validators and async validators as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('')\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')\n * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group\n *\n * The options object is used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormGroup({\n *   one: new FormControl()\n * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using a FormGroup with optional controls\n *\n * It is possible to have optional controls in a FormGroup. An optional control can be removed later\n * using `removeControl`, and can be omitted when calling `reset`. Optional controls must be\n * declared optional in the group's type.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormGroup<{one?: FormControl<string>}>({\n *   one: new FormControl('')\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that `c.value.one` has type `string|null|undefined`. This is because calling `c.reset({})`\n * without providing the optional key `one` will cause it to become `null`.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nclass FormGroup extends AbstractControl {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new `FormGroup` instance.\n   *\n   * @param controls A collection of child controls.

Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a form\n * to track aggregate form value and validation status.\n *\n * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on\n * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You optionally export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * `FormGroup` instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * gives you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, use `NgModel` with a `name`\n * attribute. You may use `NgModelGroup` to create sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * If necessary, listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event emits the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.\n * To import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,\n * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, add the `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`\n * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is\n * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would\n * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Listening for form submission\n *\n * The following example shows how to capture the form values from the \"ngSubmit\" event.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Setting the update options\n *\n * The following example shows you how to change the \"updateOn\" option from its default using\n * ngFormOptions.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form [ngFormOptions]=\"{updateOn: 'blur'}\">\n *    <input name=\"one\" ngModel>  <!-- this ngModel will update on blur -->\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Native DOM validation UI\n *\n * In order to prevent the native DOM form validation UI from interfering with Angular's form\n * validation, Angular automatically adds the `novalidate` attribute on any `<form>` whenever\n * `FormModule` or `ReactiveFormModule` are imported into the application.\n * If you want to explicitly enable native DOM validation UI with Angular forms, you can add the\n * `ngNativeValidate` attribute to the `<form>` element:\n *\n * ```html\n * <form ngNativeValidate>\n *   ...\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nclass NgForm extends ControlContainer {\n  constructor(validators, asyncValidators, callSetDisabledState) {\n    super();\n    this.callSetDisabledState = callSetDisabledState;\n    /**\n     * @description\n     * Returns whether the form submission has been triggered.\n     */\n    this.submitted = false;\n    this._directives = new Set();\n    /**\n     * @description\n     * Event emitter for the \"ngSubmit\" event\n     */\n    this.ngSubmit = new EventEmitter();\n    this.form = new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n  }\n  /** @nodoc */\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\n    this._setUpdateStrategy();\n  }\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * The directive instance.\n   */\n  get formDirective() {\n    return this;\n  }\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * The internal `FormGroup` instance.\n   */\n  get control() {\n    return this.form;\n  }\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Returns an array representing the path to this group.

See a full list of properties directly available in\n * `AbstractControlDirective`.\n *\n * @see {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * @see {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control\n *\n * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,\n * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a\n * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f=\"ngForm\"`). Use the variable where\n * needed on form submission.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * ### Using ngModel within a form\n *\n * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group\n *\n * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control\n * within a form. This controls the display of the form, but doesn't contain form data.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form>\n *   <input name=\"login\" ngModel placeholder=\"Login\">\n *   <input type=\"checkbox\" ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{standalone: true}\"> Show more options?\n * </form>\n * <!-- form value: {login: ''} -->\n * ```\n *\n * ### Setting the ngModel `name` attribute through options\n *\n * The following example shows you an alternate way to set the name attribute. Here,\n * an attribute identified as name is used within a custom form control component. To still be able\n * to specify the NgModel's name, you must specify it using the `ngModelOptions` input instead.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form>\n *   <my-custom-form-control name=\"Nancy\" ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{name: 'user'}\">\n *   </my-custom-form-control>\n * </form>\n * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nclass NgModel extends NgControl {\n  constructor(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors, _changeDetectorRef, callSetDisabledState) {\n    super();\n    this._changeDetectorRef = _changeDetectorRef;\n    this.callSetDisabledState = callSetDisabledState;\n    this.control = new FormControl();\n    /** @internal */\n    this._registered = false;\n    /**\n     * @description\n     * Tracks the name bound to the directive.

It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run.

The\n * following corner-cases will be validated:\n *\n * 1. Overlap of animations\n * Given that a CSS property cannot be animated in more than one place at the same time, it's\n * important that this behavior is detected and validated. The way in which this occurs is that\n * each time a style property is examined, a string-map containing the property will be updated with\n * the start and end times for when the property is used within an animation step.\n *\n * If there are two or more parallel animations that are currently running (these are invoked by the\n * group()) on the same element then the validator will throw an error.

This means\n * that when functional composition mix of these functions is evaluated (like in the example above)\n * then it will end up producing a tree of objects representing the animation itself.\n *\n * When this animation object tree is processed by the visitor code below it will visit each of the\n * verb statements within the visitor. And during each visit it will build the context of the\n * animation keyframes by interacting with the `TimelineBuilder`.\n *\n * [TimelineBuilder]\n * This class is responsible for tracking the styles and building a series of keyframe objects for a\n * timeline between a start and end time. The builder starts off with an initial timeline and each\n * time the AST comes across a `group()`, `keyframes()` or a combination of the two within a\n * `sequence()` then it will generate a sub timeline for each step as well as a new one after\n * they are complete.\n *\n * As the AST is traversed, the timing state on each of the timelines will be incremented. If a sub\n * timeline was created (based on one of the cases above) then the parent timeline will attempt to\n * merge the styles used within the sub timelines into itself (only with group() this will happen).\n * This happens with a merge operation (much like how the merge works in mergeSort) and it will only\n * copy the most recently used styles from the sub timelines into the parent timeline. This ensures\n * that if the styles are used later on in another phase of the animation then they will be the most\n * up-to-date values.\n *\n * [How Missing Styles Are Updated]\n * Each timeline has a `backFill` property which is responsible for filling in new styles into\n * already processed keyframes if a new style shows up later within the animation sequence.\n *\n * ```\n * sequence([\n *   style({ width: 0 }),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 100 })),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 200 })),\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 300 }))\n *   animate(1000, style({ width: 400, height: 400 })) // notice how `height` doesn't exist anywhere\n * else\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * What is happening here is that the `height` value is added later in the sequence, but is missing\n * from all previous animation steps. Therefore when a keyframe is created it would also be missing\n * from all previous keyframes up until where it is first used. For the timeline keyframe generation\n * to properly fill in the style it will place the previous value (the value from the parent\n * timeline) or a default value of `*` into the backFill map.\n *\n * When a sub-timeline is created it will have its own backFill property. This is done so that\n * styles present within the sub-timeline do not accidentally seep into the previous/future timeline\n * keyframes\n *\n * [Validation]\n * The code in this file is not responsible for validation.
